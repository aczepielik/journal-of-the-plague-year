# Upon "A Journal of the Plague Year": accompanying code


## Download data

1. Go to `sources` directory.
2. Run `./get_extensive_bills.sh` and `./get_guardian_data.sh`


## Clean data

In the project root directory, run `scripts/clean_and_save.R`

## Exploratory part

Go through `scripts/plots.R`. Run lines one by one, like it was a notebook. Then go to `scripts/interactive_map.R` and do the same.

## Models

### My own implementation in R

Run `scripts/mle_models.R` like a notebook.

### Reproduction in Python

Investigate notebooks in `scripts/pymc2_models/`.
